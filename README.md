# KAPSARC OpenData Portal

KAPSARC data portal is available to anyone interested in energy data. Portal is designed to enable users to better understand energy, economy and policies by quickly accessing and analyzing critical data.

KAPSARC data portal will serve as a prominent source of critical energy data for researchers around the globe.

Our focus is to identify critical energy data sources from **Saudi Arabia, GCC, India, China and East Africa** regions as well as some global energy data.

We have energy critical datasets for sixteen themes namely **Crude Oil & Refined Products, Natural Gas, Coal, Renewable & Alternative Fuels Nuclear, Oil & Gas, Electricity, Coal, Nuclear, Transportation, Industry, Residential, Agriculture Electricity, Environment, Economy, Demography, Trade, Water and Policies**.

KAPSARC data portal will be updated frequently to include new datasets expanding the scope of data coverage. Current datasets can be exported in csv format or data can be accessed using API to use in mobile applications.

We encourage interested parties to contact KAPSARC with any suggestions or comments that can help to drive the development of this portal.
